Number Guessing Game with Leaderboard ðŸŽ®

About This Project
This is my implementation of the Number Guessing Game with a leaderboard, developed as part of my coursework. The game allows users to guess a random number between 1 and 100. The application provides feedback, tracks the number of attempts, and dynamically displays a leaderboard showing the last three players' results. The project integrates JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an interactive, responsive, and visually appealing web application.

Features

1. Game Logic
- Random Number Generation: A random number between 1 and 100 is generated when the page loads.  
- User Input: The user enters their guess into a text input field and clicks the "Submit Guess"button.  
- Feedback: Based on the guess, the app displays:  
  - "Too High" or "Too Low" for incorrect guesses.  
  - "Correct! You guessed the number!" for a correct guess.

2. Attempts Tracker**  
- The game tracks the number of attempts the user has made and displays the count dynamically on the page.

3. Leaderboard
- The leaderboard stores the last three results, including the player's name and attempts count, and displays them in a table on the page.

4. Reset Functionality
- A "Reset Game" button is included to reset the game without refreshing the page.

JavaScript Features
